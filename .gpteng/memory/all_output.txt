I'm sorry for the misunderstanding, but as an AI, I don't have the ability to directly interact with external platforms such as GitHub. However, I can guide you on how to create a new repository on GitHub.

1. First, you need to sign in to your GitHub account. If you don't have one, you can create it at https://github.com/join.

2. Once you're logged in, click on the '+' icon in the upper right corner of the page and select 'New repository'.

3. Name your repository. You can name it anything you like, but it's usually best to choose a name that reflects the project you're working on.

4. You can choose to make your repository public or private. Public repositories are visible to everyone, while private repositories are only visible to you and people you choose to share them with.

5. You can choose to initialize your repository with a README, .gitignore, or license. A README is a document that introduces your project to visitors and explains how to use it. A .gitignore file tells Git which files or directories to ignore in your project. A license tells people what they can and cannot do with your project.

6. Click 'Create repository' to create your new repository.

7. Now you can clone the repository to your local machine and start adding files to it. To clone the repository, click the 'Code' button on your repository page, copy the URL, and then run `git clone [URL]` in your terminal.

8. After adding files to your local repository and making changes, you can push these changes to your GitHub repository by running `git add .`, `git commit -m "Your message"`, and `git push origin master` in your terminal.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
