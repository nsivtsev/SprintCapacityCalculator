Navigate to your project directory. You can do this using the `cd` command in your terminal. For example:\n\n```bash\ncd /Users/nikolaisivtsev/Projects/SprintCapacityCalculator/backend\n```\n\n2. Once you're in your project directory, you can initialize a new Go module by specifying a module path. The module path is usually a location where your module code lives. It's often the repository location if you plan to version your code with Git, Mercurial, etc. Here's an example:\n\n```bash\ngo mod init github.com/username/repo\n```\n\nReplace `github.com/username/repo` with your actual repository location. If you don't plan to version your code, you can use any string as your module path.\n\nAfter running the `go mod init` command with a specified module path, a new go.mod file should be created in your project directory.
