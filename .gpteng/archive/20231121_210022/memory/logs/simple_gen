Once you're in your project directory, you can initialize a new Go module by specifying a module path. The module path is usually a location where your module code lives. It's often the repository location if you plan to version your code with Git, Mercurial, etc. Here's an example:\n\n```bash\ngo mod init github.com/username/repo\n```\n\nReplace `github.com/username/repo` with your actual repository location.
