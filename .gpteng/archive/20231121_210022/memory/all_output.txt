It seems like you're trying to initialize a new Go module but you're encountering an error because your project directory is outside of your GOPATH. 

The `go mod init` command is used to initialize a new module, creating a go.mod file that describes the module's dependencies. 

Here's how you can resolve this issue:

1. Navigate to your project directory. You can do this using the `cd` command in your terminal. For example:

```bash
cd /Users/nikolaisivtsev/Projects/SprintCapacityCalculator/backend
```

2. Once you're in your project directory, you can initialize a new Go module by specifying a module path. The module path is usually a location where your module code lives. It's often the repository location if you plan to version your code with Git, Mercurial, etc. Here's an example:

```bash
go mod init github.com/username/repo
```

Replace `github.com/username/repo` with your actual repository location. If you don't plan to version your code, you can use any string as your module path.

After running the `go mod init` command with a specified module path, a new go.mod file should be created in your project directory. This file describes your module's dependencies.

This concludes a fully working implementation.
